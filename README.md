# Handwritten number representation with a twist: sum of number predicted with a random number between 0-9

We have built a model based on the classic MNIST data which is trained to not only identify the number in the images, but also add a random number between 0 to 9 to this predicted number.

## Primary Libraries


`import torch` : importing torch library

`import torch.nn as nn` : torch.nn provides basic building blocks for graphs, as per pytorch documentation

`import torch.nn.functional as F` : importing all the functions in torch.nn library

`import torch.optim as optim` : contains various optimization algorithms

`from torchvision import datasets, transforms` : contains popular datasets and commom image transformations for computer vision
